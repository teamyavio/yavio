This guide walks you through deploying the complete Yavio platform on your machine using Docker Compose.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker** with Docker Compose v2+ installed
- **Git** to clone the repository
- Ports **3000**, **3001**, **5432**, and **8123** available

<Steps>

<Step>

## Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yavio-ai/yavio.git
cd yavio
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Generate environment secrets

Run the setup script to create a `.env` file with random secrets:

```bash
./scripts/setup-env.sh
```

This generates cryptographically random values for `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, `JWT_SECRET`, `API_KEY_HASH_SECRET`, and `ENCRYPTION_KEY`.

<Callout type="info">
  You can also copy `.env.example` manually and fill in the secrets yourself. Generate each with `openssl rand -base64 32`.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>

## Start the platform

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts five services:

| Service | Port | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Dashboard** | `3000` | Web UI for analytics and project management |
| **Ingestion API** | `3001` | Receives events from the SDK |
| **PostgreSQL** | `5432` | Stores workspaces, projects, users, API keys |
| **ClickHouse** | `8123` | Stores analytics events |
| **Docs** | `3002` | Documentation site |

Wait for all health checks to pass:

```bash
docker compose ps
```

All services should show `healthy` status within about 30 seconds.

</Step>

<Step>

## Create your account

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser and register your first account. The first user automatically becomes the workspace owner.

</Step>

<Step>

## Create a project and API key

1. Create a workspace and project in the dashboard
2. Navigate to the project settings and generate an API key
3. Copy the key — it starts with `yav_`

</Step>

<Step>

## Connect the SDK

Point your MCP server's SDK at your local instance:

```ts title="server.ts"
import { McpServer } from "@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/server/mcp.js";
import { withYavio } from "@yavio/sdk";

const server = new McpServer({ name: "my-server", version: "1.0.0" });

const instrumented = withYavio(server, {
  apiKey: "yav_your_key_here",
  endpoint: "http://localhost:3001/v1/events",
});
```

Or use a `.yaviorc.json` config file so your code stays clean:

```json title=".yaviorc.json"
{
  "apiKey": "yav_your_key_here",
  "endpoint": "http://localhost:3001/v1/events"
}
```

```ts title="server.ts"
// withYavio() auto-reads .yaviorc.json — no config needed in code
const instrumented = withYavio(server);
```

</Step>

<Step>

## Verify events

Invoke a tool on your MCP server and check the dashboard at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). Events should appear within a few seconds.

</Step>

</Steps>

## Using the Yavio CLI

Instead of running `docker compose` commands directly, you can use the [Yavio CLI](/docs/04-self-hosting/03-cli) for a streamlined experience:

```bash
npx @yavio/cli up       # Start the platform
npx @yavio/cli status   # Check service health
npx @yavio/cli down     # Stop the platform
```
