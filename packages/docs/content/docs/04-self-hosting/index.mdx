Yavio is fully open-source and designed to run on your own infrastructure. The entire platform — dashboard, ingestion API, ClickHouse, and PostgreSQL — ships as a single Docker Compose stack.

<Callout type="info">
  **Yavio Cloud is coming soon.** Until then, self-hosting is the only way to run Yavio. The good news: you get full control over your data and zero vendor lock-in.
