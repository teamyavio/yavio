import { Callout } from "fumadocs-ui/components/callout";

The Yavio CLI (`@yavio/cli`) provides a convenient wrapper around Docker Compose for managing your self-hosted deployment. It handles health checks, environment validation, and common operations.

## Installation

```bash
# Run directly with npx (no install needed)
npx @yavio/cli <command>

# Or install globally
npm install -g @yavio/cli
yavio <command>
```

## Commands

### `yavio init`

Initialize SDK configuration in the current project. Creates a `.yaviorc.json` file and adds it to `.gitignore`.

```bash
yavio init
```

Options:
- `--api-key <key>` — API key (skips interactive prompt)
- `--endpoint <url>` — Ingestion endpoint (skips interactive prompt)

The command also verifies connectivity to the ingestion API if an endpoint is provided.

### `yavio up`

Start the self-hosted Yavio platform. Starts all Docker Compose services in detached mode and polls health endpoints until they respond.

```bash
yavio up
```

Options:
- `-f, --file <path>` — Path to a custom `docker-compose.yml`
- `--build` — Rebuild images before starting
- `--prod` — Apply production compose overrides (resource limits, log rotation)

After startup, the command prints the dashboard and ingestion URLs:

```
Dashboard:  http://localhost:3000
Ingestion:  http://localhost:3001/v1/events
```

### `yavio down`

Stop the self-hosted platform. Data volumes are preserved.

```bash
yavio down
```

Options:
- `-f, --file <path>` — Path to a custom `docker-compose.yml`

### `yavio status`

Show the health status of all platform services.

```bash
yavio status
```

Output example:

```
Yavio Platform
────────────────────────
Dashboard:      ✓ healthy (Up 2 hours)
Ingestion API:  ✓ healthy (Up 2 hours)
ClickHouse:     ✓ healthy (Up 2 hours)
PostgreSQL:     ✓ healthy (Up 2 hours)
```

Options:
- `-f, --file <path>` — Path to a custom `docker-compose.yml`

### `yavio logs [service]`

Tail logs for one or all platform services.

```bash
# All services
yavio logs

# Single service
yavio logs ingest
yavio logs dashboard
yavio logs clickhouse
yavio logs postgres
yavio logs docs
```

Options:
- `-f, --file <path>` — Path to a custom `docker-compose.yml`
- `-n, --lines <count>` — Number of historical lines (default: `100`)
- `--no-follow` — Print logs and exit instead of following

### `yavio update`

Pull the latest Docker images and restart services. Data volumes are preserved.

```bash
yavio update
```

Options:
- `-f, --file <path>` — Path to a custom `docker-compose.yml`
- `--all` — Also pull third-party images (ClickHouse, PostgreSQL)
- `--dry-run` — Show what would be updated without pulling

### `yavio reset`

Wipe data volumes and reinitialize the platform. This is a destructive operation that requires confirmation.

```bash
yavio reset
```

Options:
- `-f, --file <path>` — Path to a custom `docker-compose.yml`
- `--keep-config` — Preserve PostgreSQL data (users, projects, API keys), only wipe ClickHouse events
- `--yes --confirm-destructive` — Skip interactive confirmation (both flags required)

<Callout type="warn">
  This permanently deletes all data. Use `--keep-config` to preserve your workspace and user data while clearing analytics events.
</Callout>

### `yavio doctor`

Diagnose common setup issues. Checks Node.js version, Docker availability, config files, service connectivity, TLS, and port conflicts.

```bash
yavio doctor
```

Output example:

```
Yavio Doctor
────────────
✓ Node.js v22.0.0 (>= 20 required)
✓ Docker v27.0.0 available
✓ docker compose v2.29.0 available
✓ .yaviorc.json found (API key: yav_abc12345...)
✓ Ingestion API reachable at http://localhost:3001/health
✓ Dashboard reachable at http://localhost:3000/api/health
✓ No port conflicts detected (3000, 3001, 5432, 8123)

All critical checks passed.
```

### `yavio telemetry`

Manage anonymous usage telemetry. Telemetry is stored in `~/.yavio/config.json`.

```bash
yavio telemetry status    # Show current setting
yavio telemetry enable    # Enable telemetry
yavio telemetry disable   # Disable telemetry
```
