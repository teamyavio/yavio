import { Card, Cards } from "fumadocs-ui/components/card";

The Yavio Ingestion API is the HTTP interface used by the server SDK and widget SDK to send analytics events. All endpoints are served by the `@yavio/ingest` service (default port 3001).

You typically don't need to call these endpoints directly — the SDK handles event batching and delivery automatically. This reference is useful for building custom integrations or debugging.

## Authentication

All endpoints (except `/health`) require a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header:

- **Server SDK** — uses a project API key (`yav_...`) obtained from the Yavio dashboard
- **Widget SDK** — uses a short-lived JWT minted by the server via `POST /v1/widget-tokens`
