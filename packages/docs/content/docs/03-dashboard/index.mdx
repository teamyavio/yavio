The Yavio Dashboard is your central hub for understanding how users interact with your MCP tools and widgets. It provides real-time analytics, funnel visualization, error tracking, and user-level insights.

<Callout type="info">
  **Yavio Cloud is coming soon.** Currently, the dashboard is available as a self-hosted deployment only. You can run the full platform on your own infrastructure using Docker Compose or the Yavio CLI. See [Self-Hosting](/docs/04-self-hosting) to get started.
