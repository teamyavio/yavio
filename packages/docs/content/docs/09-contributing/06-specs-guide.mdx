description: How to read and update the /specs directory
---

The `.specs/` directory in the repository root contains the **pre-build technical architecture specification** — the source of truth for implementation decisions. This is separate from the documentation site you're reading now, which is the **post-build user-facing documentation**.

## Specs vs Docs

| Aspect | `.specs/` | `packages/docs/` |
|--------|-----------|-------------------|
| Audience | Internal (builders) | External (users + contributors) |
| Content | Architecture decisions, schemas, data flow | How-to guides, API reference, tutorials |
| Format | Markdown (GitHub-rendered) | MDX (Fumadocs site) |
| Lifecycle | Written before code, updated as decisions change | Written alongside code, updated with releases |

Some content flows from specs to docs: event schemas, API route tables, and architecture diagrams originate in specs and are adapted (not copied) into user-facing docs with appropriate context and examples.

## Document Structure

### Platform-Wide

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `01_executive-summary.md` | Scope, key architecture decisions, pricing tiers |
| `02_package-architecture.md` | Package overview with links to per-service specs |
| `03_testing.md` | Testing strategy overview |
| `04_roadmap.md` | Implementation roadmap |
| `05_appendix.md` | Dependencies, performance targets, open questions |
| `07_error-catalog.md` | Error code catalog (YAVIO-1000 through YAVIO-7999) |
| `metrics/events.md` | All captured event types and their fields |
| `metrics/metrics.md` | Derived metrics computed from events |

### Per-Service

Each service has its own directory with focused specs:

| Directory | Contents |
|-----------|----------|
| `sdk/` | SDK architecture, server proxy, widget hook, testing, roadmap |
| `ingest/` | Event pipeline, testing, roadmap |
| `dashboard/` | Dashboard architecture, design guide, testing, roadmap |
| `cli/` | CLI architecture, roadmap |
| `infrastructure/` | Platform layout, storage layer, deployment, CI/CD, observability |
| `pricing/` | Pricing tiers, Stripe billing integration |
| `docs/` | Documentation site architecture and roadmap |

## Reading Specs

When working on a feature, start with:

1. **`04_roadmap.md`** — find which phase your feature belongs to
2. **The relevant service spec** — understand the architecture decisions
3. **`metrics/events.md`** — if your feature involves event capture
4. **`07_error-catalog.md`** — if you need to add error codes

## Updating Specs

Specs are living documents. Update them when:

- **An architecture decision changes** — update the relevant spec file and note the change
- **A new feature is designed** — write the spec before implementing
- **Implementation reveals a spec inaccuracy** — fix the spec to match reality

### Guidelines

- Keep specs concise and focused on **decisions**, not implementation details
- Use tables for structured data (schemas, configurations, comparisons)
- Link between specs rather than duplicating content
- Number files for ordering within directories (e.g., `01-events.mdx`)
- Status should be clear: is this decided, proposed, or implemented?

## Adding New Specs

1. Determine the appropriate directory (service-specific or platform-wide)
2. Create a new markdown file with a descriptive name
3. Add a link from the parent `README.md` or the relevant overview spec
4. Follow the existing format — title, overview, tables, code examples
